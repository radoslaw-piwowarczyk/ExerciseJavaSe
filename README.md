    /**
     * Write a program in which you pass any number of integers as arguments to it. Display on screen:
     * the number of numbers transferred
     * transferred numbers
     * squares of transferred numbers
     * sum of all transferred numbers in the form A + B + C + ... + N = SUM
     * In the task, we assume that the user does not pass any arguments or passes the correct numeric arguments
     * (we do not have to worry about the fact that the argument may be, for example, a string "abc")
