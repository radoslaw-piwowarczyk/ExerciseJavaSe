/**
 * Define a Convertible class representing a car with an opening roof. The car should store
 * information about the name, brand, but also whether it is currently in motion and whether
 * the roof is open. The limitation is that it should not be possible to open or close the
 * roof while the car is in motion. If the car is moving and someone tries to open or fold
 * the roof, an error message should be displayed and the roof should remain in its current
 * position. In a separate class, create an object representing the car and test the opening
 * of the roof when the car is moving and at rest.
