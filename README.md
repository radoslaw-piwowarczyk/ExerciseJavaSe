/**
 * Write a program that will consist of several classes.
 *
 * Employee - represents the employee, should have at least fields for storing the first name, last name and monthly salary
 * PaymentCalculator - a payroll calculator with the netYearPayment and grossYearPayment methods. Both methods should accept
 * an object of the Employee type as an argument. The first returns the annual sum of the salaries of a given employee, while
 * the second returns the annual sum of salaries together with additional taxes (ZUS, taxes to the tax office). For the sake
 * of simplicity, we assume that the monthly cost of ZUS is PLN 1000 and the income tax is 20%.
 * In the test class, create at least one employee and calculate his annual salary and the annual total cost of the employer.
 *
 * For example, for an employee earning PLN 3,000 a month, we should receive:
 *
 * PLN 36,000 - because 3,000 * 12 = 36,000
 *
 * PLN 55,200 - because 12 * 1000 + 12 * (3000 + 0.2 * 3000) = 55200, where 3000 is the net payment, and 1000 is the cost of ZUS
